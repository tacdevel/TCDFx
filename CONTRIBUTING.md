# Contributing to TAC Development Libraries

It's great to not only see the community take an interest in this project, but also take an interest in contributing as
well. The goal of this document is to make the contibuting process as simple and transperent as possible, whether it's:

  - Reporting a bug or other issue.
  - Discussing the current state of the code.
  - Submitting a bug fix.
  - Proposing a new feature.
  - Becoming a maintainer.

We use [GitHub](https://github.com)'s services to host our code, track issues and releases, and accept code changes via
pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Submitting a pull request is easy. Just follow the steps below:

  1. Fork the repository and create a new branch off of `master`
  2. If there is testable code, add tests (if you know how to write them)
  3. If you have changed/added any public APIs, update the corresponding documentation.
  4. Ensure to run all tests (if any) and make sure they pass.
  5. Make sure your documentation follows our [coding styles](#coding-styles)
  6. [Submit your pull request](https://github.com/tom-corwin/tacdevlibs/pull/new)!

### Coding Styles

Basic guidelines are listed below:

  - Spaces, not tabs
  - 4 spaces per tab
  - No trailing whitespace (including a new line at the end of a file)

For the most part, everything should be formatted as per the suggestions in the error list in either Visual Studio or
Visual Studio Code, since we use an `.editorconfig` file.

## Issue/Bug Reporting

Reporting an issue is even easier than submitting a pull request. Just
[click here](https://github.com/tom-corwin/tacdevlibs/issues/new?template=bug-report.md) and follow the steps in the
issue template, and create the issue!

## Requesting a Feature/Enhancement

Requesting a feature or enhancement is just like reporting an issue.
[Click here](https://github.com/tom-corwin/tacdevlibs/issues/new?template=feature-request.md) and follow the steps in the
issue template, and create the issue!

## Contribution Licensing

When you submit a pull request or issue, your submissions are understood to be under the same
[license](https://github.com/tom-corwin/tacdevlibs/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact
a project maintainer if that is a concern.
